## Jason Verber

I have over a decade of experience working in higher education and nearly twice that coding. I am driven by a love of learning and problem-solving to create solutions to real-world problems, with a focus on systems analysis and integration in order to optimize workflows.

You can see some of my work [on GitHub](https://github.com/jasonverber/).
